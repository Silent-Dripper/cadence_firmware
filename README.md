# Cadence Firmware

The core firmware is in `./cadence-firmware`. This is the code that should be uploaded in a production environment.

There are a few test sketches in `./test` that verify the functionality in the core `cadence-firmware`. For each of these sketches, there may or may not be docs at the top of the respective `.ino`s.
